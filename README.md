# form-filler
A specific chrome extension for typo3 backend. I made it for a friend of mine, who is dealing with data entry.

In order to use the extension, go to: chrome://extensions/

From there select "Developer Mode" then "Load Unpacked Extension" and select the folder.

Now, this form filler can be adapted into different forms as well. Typo3 uses different input fields for data, therefore while using not visible values are updated, instead hidden fields are directly manipulated.
